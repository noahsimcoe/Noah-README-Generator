## Noah's README Generator
Challenge 09 - Node.js

## Description
I built this project to demonstrate my understanding of using Node.js. I proved that I knew how to initialize projects and install packages by using "npm init" and "npm install", and I also demonstrated my ability to use FS to write files that can include the user's input. I also took advantage of the "inquirer" package and demonstrated my ability to use it's prompt method to collect user input in the terminal.

When building this project I learned how you can inject certain types of text from a JS file into different file types that you're created (in this case: markdown) and how there are small differences between files. An example of this is how links are injected differently on markdown, without the use of "a href" tags. I also learned how you can import certain functions from js file to another, and how that can be used to separate code and help keep it more organized.

## Installation
This project is NOT deployed on GitHub Pages, but installation and usage of the project can be viewed through the screencastify video provided in this README file.

## Usage
This project is used generate a professional README file for the user's projects that they have worked on. Once the user runs "node index.js" in the terminal, they will be presented with a list of questions regarding specifics about the project that will be included in the generated README. Once the user has answered all of the prompts, the file is created and can be viewed as README2.md.


Additionally, here is a screenshot of what it looks like.
